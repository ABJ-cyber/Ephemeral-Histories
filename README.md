# Ephemeral-Histories


Ephemeral Histories is an interactive storytelling platform that reveals the hidden stories and histories of cities through an augmented reality (AR) experience. As users explore different locations, they can access short narratives linked to those specific spots, contributed by a community of storytellers.

## Features

- **Augmented Reality Views**: Experience stories overlaid on real-world landmarks using your mobile device.
- **Story Contributions**: Users can submit their own stories, creating a rich, diverse tapestry of narratives.
- **Ephemeral Content**: Stories are temporary, creating an ever-changing landscape of tales and experiences.
- **Community Driven**: Stories are upvoted and commented on by the community, emphasizing popular narratives.
